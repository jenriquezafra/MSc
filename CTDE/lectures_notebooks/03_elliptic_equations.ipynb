    "If the origin is within the domain and $0 \\le \\theta < 2\\pi$, we have a periodic boundary condition in the $\\theta$ direction (i.e., $u(r, \\theta) = u(r, \\theta + 2\\pi)$), but in the radial $(r)$ direction the origin $R_1=0$ needs special attention. The PDE is singular at $r=0$, which is called a **pole singularity**.\n",

    "The main new feature of polar coordinates is the condition that must be imposed at this point. It is important to realize that any difficulties that arise at the origin are only a result of the choice of coordinate system and are not reflected in the continuous function $u(r, \\theta)$.\n",
